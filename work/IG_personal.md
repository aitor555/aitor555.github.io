	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>	
	<p>Ever since I started getting into graphic design, long before I was doing it professionally, I've been posting my designs on instagram. This archive, which I have been posting to since around late 2017 has served as sort of a timeline of my skillset, creativity and tastes, and is where I post a majority of my personal work.</p>
	<p>I had my start in graphic design with the vaporwave aesthetic as it was an accessible and fascinating aesthetic and this aesthetic still influences my work to this day. pretty quickly I got into different styles once I started really looking into graphic design, and started exploring and expanding my style. Quickly I was drawn into scifi and cyberpunk media, and my interest in videogames pushed me further into that direction. </p>
	<p>My aesthetic has morphed a lot since then, and I've picked up more and more influences as time progressed. I've chosen here just a few of my designs to show off here with different vibes.</p>
	<h2>In order of appearance these are:</h2>
	<p>
	<bold>Macroblank</bold> - A fake album inspired by stuff like "haircuts for men" and the like. I chose to imagine a post-vaporwave compilation album and design for that.<br><br>
	<bold>Visions</bold> - another fake, post-vaporwave album, here i was really trying had to make a cleaner aproach to vaporwave aesthetics while keeping the usual tropes.<br><br>
	<bold>Die Jones</bold> - I made this as a critique of war profiteering, with references to the "i want you for the us army" poster from WW1.<br><br>
	<bold>Zeitgeist</bold> - This design did not have a theme when I made it and I simply wanted to experiment with something kind of brutalist. It ended up being some sort of crowded, loud design with plenty of detail that has influenced my future work since.
