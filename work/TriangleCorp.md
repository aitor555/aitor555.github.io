	<p>Project TriangleCorp is a near future sci-fi/cyberpunk universe I am working on, spanning from around the next 10 years to up to around 200 years into the future (so far). In this universe, corporations are the major forces of the world, even more than the governments that supposedly are in control. The story includes the balkanization of the US, political unrest in europe as well as a developing but unstable Africa. As a part of the project I have created a few companies and given them different brand identities.</p>
	<p><bold>Triangle Corp:</bold> Triangle Corp (originally 三角形Triangle) is a tech company founded in china in the late 2010s, its explosive growth has led to the company having unprecedented power both inlands and abroad, and what started as a small computer manufacturer has become a military contractor, software company and importantly a space technology firm whose current mission includes colonizing and terraforming mars. This has made the company create a daughter company, TriangleRGB.
	<br><br>
	TriangleRGB is a company focused on the colonization of mars. the <b>RGB</b> in the name is a reference to the Mars book trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, in which mars gets terraformed.</p>
