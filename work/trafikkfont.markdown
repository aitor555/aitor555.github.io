	<p>trafikk regular is an open source font inspired by norwegian road signage. It's based on official specifications made by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen), but with modifications done to certain characters to make it more consistent. It also has a multitude of characters which were made specifically for the font which had to be made from scratch, including an extended latin alphabet (and cyrillic letters on its way).</p>
	<p>I originally only made this font for myself as i needed it for a project. But as I started developing it further I decided to share it with the internet. The font is completely free and open source and you're allowed to do whatever you wish to with it. Print it, sell it, bundle it, get it tattooed etc idc.</p>
	<p>While its not finished yet, You can download the font <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/downloads/Trafikk-regular.ttf" download>for free here.</a></p>
