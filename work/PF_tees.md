	<p>Various tshirt designs I've made for grassroots media organization<a href="https://www.popularfront.co/" target="_blank">Popular Front</a>. The first one was created to celebrate their 5 year anniversay. It is styled as band tour merch and features locations that Popular Front has done work in.</p>
	<p>The second one is based off an earlier design I did, originally referencing the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, now advertising PF! (This is one of my favourite t-shirts and I wear it all the time).</p>
	<p>The third shirt is also based off an earlier design of mine. This time referencing the iconic James Montgomery Flagg propaganda poster of <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/ppmsc.03521/" target="_blank">uncle sam urging people to sign up for the army.</a></p>
