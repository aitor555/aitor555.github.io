	<p>This is the first portfolio I made during my first few weeks at NTNU. It is incredibly simple and silly but I had a lot of fun creating it and it served as good intro into web development. Of course in hindsight there are many things I would change about it but it serves as a reminder of where I started my webdev journey.</p>
	<p>The visual aesthetic of the page is purposefully retro and I tried to mimic the vaporwave aesthetic by using anachronistic elements that remind of the web 1.0. I tried to reference GeoCities somewhat!</p>
