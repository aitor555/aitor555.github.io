	<p>This is the first portfolio I made during my first few weeks at NTNU. It is incredibly simple and silly but I had a lot of fun creating it and it served as good intro into web development. Of course in hindsight there are many things I would change about it but it serves as a reminder of where I started my webdev journey.</p>
	<p>The visual aesthetic of the page is purposefully retro and I tried to mimic the vaporwave aesthetic by using anachronistic elements that remind of the web 1.0. I tried to reference GeoCities somewhat in my design. Although it was quite a crude attempt at a retro vaporwave aesthetic, I feel that I managed to somewhat replicate the aesthetic.</p>
	<p>On a technical level the page is not very advanced but it definetly was helpful for getting better at web development. It was the first time i used techniques such as flexbox and more modern CSS as opposed to the more primitive HTML/CSS I had been using when I was a kid. (remember using tables and images for the entire website? &#x1F92E;)</p>
