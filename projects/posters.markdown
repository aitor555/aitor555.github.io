	<p>I love making graphics and designs so naturally this extends to posters and such. While most of the designs I make are in 1:1 ratio to fit the instragram layout, sometimes I go out of my comfort zone and make a poster. not much else to it I just enjoy making them. I've only made a few as its not my usual format but the ones I <b>have</b> made, I am proud of.</p>
