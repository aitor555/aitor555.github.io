	<p><a href="https://github.com/nature-heart-software/izabela" target="_blank">Izabela</a> is a text to speech application built in Electron for gamers who wish to communicate in voice chats without using their own voice. One of my best friends cannot speak and as such needs assistive technology to do this. They found Izabela to be helpful when gaming, and wish to be able to use it elsehwere. For that reason I've decided to port it to Android so that my friend can express themselves how they wish when they're not at their computer.</p>
