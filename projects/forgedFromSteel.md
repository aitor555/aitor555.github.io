	<p>One of my first real design commissions was for a rollerblading clothing company based in Sheffield called <bold>Forged from Steel</bold>. They originally comissioned me for just one t-shirt design, but ended up ordering two of them as well as an alternate version of their main logo. I enjoyed doing this project quite a lot because they gave me a general idea of the vibe they wanted but still left room for me to play and experiment with the layout, elements, etc.</p>
	<p>The designs are heavily influenced by the rugged, industrial image of Sheffield, historically an important city for steel production.</p>
