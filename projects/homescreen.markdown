	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>	
	<p>In my 3 years as a student at NTNU Iâ€™ve designed and made multiple startpages for my browser. A startpage is an HTML file that appears when you open a new tab, and serves as a hub for easy access to your most used websites and other information. Common elements of a startpage would be information such as links, a clock, and some sort of decorative element. In terms of design and coding they are usually not very complex, but simple utilitarian projects that also provide an aesthetic quality for its user (which in this case is me).</p>
	<p>This is my latest iteration of my startpage. It has been designed with a couple of things in mind. One of the key reasons I enjoy making them is being able to experiment with HTML and CSS in a constructive way, while also creating something that is functional and fun to look at. I really wanted to use this clip path trick that I saw online to create these squares with chopped off edges, and I also wanted to try out the javascript library called <a href="https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/" target="_blank">tilt.js</a> which lead me to the creation of this design.</p>
	<p>One thing that I really wanted to do was include alot of different functionality, including a weather widget and RSS feed that keeps me updated on both local norwegian news as well as international news. I've included examples with different backgrounds to show the versatility of the project.</p>
