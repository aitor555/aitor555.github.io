	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
	<p>In our first year of webdev one of our tasks was to redesign the website for the department of design, the brief was to not only redesign the page but also include a sign up form, as well as a list of courses available for the different programmes at the department of design.</p>
	<p>I decided to go for a minimal modern design that not only fit in with the current style of ntnu but also look sleek enough to flex my design skills. By having a sleek modern header that goes from transparent to black as you scroll makes the herobanner on the startpage all that more striking.</p>
	<p>The project was done as an obligatory assigment at NTNU and is hosted on <a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/gabrima/substantialleopard/" target="_blank">my folk page here.</a></p>
