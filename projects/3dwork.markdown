	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
	<p>I've created many designs in blender through the years of using the software. Most of what I make get used in bigger projects that involve mixing graphic design, 3D and sometimes video editing. However sometimes I create scenes that are standalone of any other projects. I enjoy the creative process of 3D scenes very much although it is very different than other processes I'm used to. </p>
	<p>I really enjoy making interior scenes as architecture and interior designs are huge passions of mine outside of my professional work. I'm by no means a professional and my initial interest in 3D came from wanting to create videogames as a child. This later developed into wanting to create worlds and scenes as I envisoned them in my head. It is a skill that I wish to further develop as I am intersted in potentially making animations further down the line.</p>
