	<p>I'm constantly inspired by the world around me and take great influence from the most random of places. As such my aesthetic is very fluid and I can find myself craving change. With this comes the feeling of having to change my surroundings to match my current mood. As a designer this bleeds into how I brand myself and my social media, to best reflect to others my personality. t</p>
	<p>These changes can be very minute, and gradually morphing from one idea to the next means that there isn't always a clear line between whats what. It can therefore be hard for me to identify when my aesthetic has changed. I want my website to not only represent me as a person and my style and ethos, but also be a representation of what I can provide for my clients as a designer and developer. The current design of the website (as of spring 2024) feels lacking to me. It was originally designed for my last year at NTNU, and followed the criteria set by the school, and at the time it served its purpose. By now I've grown tired of some of the deisgn choices I made during that time, and also wish to update the content, to better reflect what I do.</p>
	<p>I've decided that the site layout needs an update, and that I want to introduce a "projects" section where I can share with the world the projects I'm working on. In addition to being able to share a bit of myself with the world, this also serves as a nifty to-do list for myself. When this page goes live the projects page will be there, and some major UI changes as well, however the full site will not be completed which is why this is labeled as "in progress". I plan to post some of the finished projects on my blog depending on the type of content.</p>
